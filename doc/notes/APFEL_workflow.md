# APFEL workflow

For my personal convenience I'm trying to reconstruct the workflow of APFEL, the
one produced with `yadism/benchmarks/test_LO.py`, that is reproducing the one
generated by `apfel/examples/DISObservables.f`.

## Workflow

### APFEL loading

Done by `apfel_import.py`.

- **CleanUp**
    - erase all the `In*` variables with `xxxx`, they will be subsequently
      replaced with `done` to indicate that the corresponding variables are set
- **SetX**
    - set all the parameters taken from the theory (`test_dict`) given to the
      load function (`load_apfel`)
- **InitializeAPFEL**
    - call 'initParametersDIS' to set defaults for those parameters not already
      set
    -
