Processes
=========

Weights
-------

The choice of the process will affect the coefficient functions, in particular
they will be different for |NC| and |CC|, but the |EM| are exactly the same of
the |NC| (because the diagram are exactly the same for the :math:`\gamma` and
the :math:`Z`).

But coefficient functions are not the only relevant thing about processes,
indeed they will affect also the coupling to the quarks and the relation
between the *hadronic* and *leptonic* part of |DIS|.

.. todo::

   Here a picture made with Inkscape of DIS diagram to make it clear what is
   the hadronic part, what the leptonic and where the coupling are coming into
   the game.

These two further contributions are collected in what we call the **weight**
of each coefficient function (i.e. the weight of each element of the flavor
basis, but we stress that (coefficient functions, processes) and weights are
mapped :math:`1 \leftrightarrow 1`).

In the following the description of the weights for each kind of |DIS| process.

Structure
~~~~~~~~~

Define the coefficient from *factorization scheme*.

Do we want to include also the perturbative expansion convention? (expand in
``a_s``)

- leptonic
- propagator
- hadronic
- factorization formula contributions
