Factorization
=============

.. todo::

   Here a picture made with Inkscape of DIS diagram to make it clear what is
   the hadronic part, what the leptonic and where the coupling are coming into
   the game.

We refer to Factorization as the universal property that the |DIS| cross section
can be factored into different parts: **DIS Factorization** ensures that
the cross section can be split into a *leptonic* and an *hadronic* part.
In *addition* on the hadronic part **QCD Factorization** ensures that the structure
functions can be split into an perturbative hard matix element and a non-perturbative |PDF|.

As said, for the notation we're following :cite:`Zyla:2020zbs`.

DIS Factorization
-----------------

We write for the fully inclusive cross section

.. math ::
    \frac{d\sigma^i}{dx dy} = \frac{4\pi \alpha^2}{x y Q^2} \eta^i \left\{
    \left(1-y - \frac{x^2 y^2 M^2}{Q^2}\right)F_2^i
    + y^2 x F_1^i
    \pm \left(y - \frac {y^2}{2} \right) x F_3^i
    \right\}

where :math:`i = \{NC, CC\}` corresponds to the |NC| or |CC| processes, respectively,
and the :math:`-` sign in front of :math:`F_3` is taken for an incoming :math:`e^+`
or :math:`\bar \nu` and the :math:`+` sign for an incoming :math:`e^-` or :math:`\nu`.

- leptonic
- propagator

QCD Factorization
-----------------

- include the perturbative expansion convention (expand in ``a_s``)
- hadronic
- factorization formula contributions
