Extras
======

Extra tools for debugging and benchmarking `yadism`.

GeneratePDF
-----------

It is able to generate a custom PDF set in the `lhapdf` format, just providing
a suitable function or constant value for each PID.

Essentially it works calling the specified functions and filling a `jinja`
template.

Profiling
---------

Currently only experiments in profiling some `yadism`'s runs.
