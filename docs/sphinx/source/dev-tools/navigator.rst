Navigator
=========

Enter through the entry script `navigator` running:
```shell
./navigator
```
in `benchmarks` folder.

The script will load the full interface and drop into an `ipython` interpreter
instance, so the interface is available as a set of python functions.
Once inside the interpreter all the functions in:

- the interface
- `pylab`

will be available without any prefix (they are imported in the global namespace).
