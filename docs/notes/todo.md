## Features
- Heavy Flavours
- Scale Variations
  - dynamic scale in F2charm
- FNS
  - go beyond 3 flavours
  - DampingFONLL
  - MaxNfPdf
- Heavy Quark Mass Scheme
- IntrinsicCharm
- TMC
- polarization
- charged current (W+/-)
- QED corrections (electroweak)
  - do we?
  - if yes: speak with Christopher

- sigma level
  - maybe related to sigma (full cross section) rather than structure functions
  - Z propagator corrections
  - projectile
  - target

### to be understood
from the theory dictionary:
- `global_nx`
- `EScaleVar`
  - probably: `ExcludeScaleVariations`

## Orders
- NNLO
- N3LO

## not in `yadism`
- Semi Inclusive Annihilation (SIA)
- Small-x resummation / HELL
