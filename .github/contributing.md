# Contributing to Yadism

Currently the main guideline we would like to highlight is to use
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/N3PDF/yadism/issues) for requests, bugs reporting, and any
other communication, and [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/N3PDF/yadism/pulls) for code
contributions.

Please take the time to fulfill the proper template (it will be automatically provided).

## Release based workflow
Since we are adopting a release based workflow choose a *suitable base* for your
*pull request*:
- if you are submitting a quick fix, or small proposal, choose as base a `feature/**/*` 
  or `release/**/*` branch
- if you are setting up a major update (i.e. your new branch itself is a `feature/**/*` 
  or `release/**/*` one) choose as base `master`
