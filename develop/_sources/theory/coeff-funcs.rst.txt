Coefficient Functions Calculation
=================================


Coefficients conventions (aka "weights")
----------------------------------------
Define the coefficient from *factorization scheme*.

Do we want to include also the perturbative expansion convention? (expand in
``a_s``)

- leptonic
- propagator
- hadronic
- factorization formula contributions

Neutral Currents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- electromagnetic
- z: vectorial-vectorial, axial-axial
- f3: vectorial-axial

Charged Currents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ckm
- W+/-

Regular - Singular - Local
--------------------------
Define the split in three bits.

Convolution Integral
--------------------
How we recast convolution in an integration in [0,1] (where plus distributions
are properly defined) plus some addends.
